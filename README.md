# notes-app
simple notes app for my own personal needs

This is a simple lists app written in next.js.

My goal was to have an app where I could control lists both from phone and laptop.

Next steps
replace the twilio free tier with something more durable (maybe firebase sms auth)
create a CLI
Nice to haves
port the CLI api into a brew formula
local editing, especially on iPhone
better support for iPhone PWA, look into bookmarking & offline
revamp the UI, introduce light/dark themes
